## Welcome to STATS 315 / DATA SCI 315

This is an introductory deep learning course using the Python programming language and the Tensorflow deep learning library.

- **Textbook**: We will not follow any textbook too closely. Our primary reference will be _Introduction to Deep Learning_ by Charniak. It is available from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-deep-learning). A couple of additional references are:
  - _Deep Learning with Python (2nd edition)_ by Chollet. A solid hands-on guide to deep learning from the creator of the Keras deep learning library. Ebook and print versions are available from [Manning Publications](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition).
  - _Deep Learning_ by Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville. Written by three of the top researchers this advanced level book is required reading if you want to pursue your stufy of deep learning at a more advanced level. Print version is available from [MIT Press](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/deep-learning) and an online version is [here](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
- **Canvas**: You should access the Canvas class page for this course frequently. It will let you access important announcements and track course deliverables.
- **Slack**: The course slack workspace is at [um-wn22-stats315.slack.com](https://um-wn22-stats315.slack.com) (requires UM login)
